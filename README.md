# hmujib-personalsite
This was my personal site that I used during my first job hunt after graudating. I've grown a lot since then, so I think it's time to re-do the site and show my current accomplishments and skills.

I'm going to be using this README as a notepad to remind myself what things I want to include while I come up with a design!

- Join The Pact (Dev, Technical Design)
- Yuzuri (Solo development, Technical Design
